## Flex Dashboard

Played with css flex. Idea was that content should move also when menu is opening.

# Menu open

![Menu open](https://github.com/dinogit/flex-dashboard/blob/master/img/expand.png?raw=true "Title")

# Menu closed

![Menu closed](https://github.com/dinogit/flex-dashboard/blob/master/img/shrinked.png?raw=true "Title")
